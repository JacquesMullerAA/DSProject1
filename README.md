## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

I was interested in using Boston Airbnb listings data from 2016 to answer the following questions:

1. Who are the most popular hosts?
2. Which neighbourhoods are you most likely to stay in?
3. What determines the price, and can it be predicted?

The files for this analysis are located [here](https://github.com/JacquesMullerAA/DSProject1).

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook to perform the initial data preparation, and 3 notebooks to answer each of the 3 questions. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://jacquesmul.medium.com/3-questions-answered-about-airbnbs-in-boston-85574b14ecc2).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Information on the data used can be found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston). Feel free to use the code here as you would like!
